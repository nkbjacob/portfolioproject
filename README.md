# portfolioproject

Thank you for viewing my project, which is focused on sharing an overview of some of my design work. I used the CSS Essential Training module as a starting-off point, editing the HTML and CSS to meet my needs.

For the CSS responsiveness, you will see breaking points established for the header/profile section, the projects section, and the work experience section. 

For the JavaScript, I added a link to a contact form that exists on its own page. A link to the form appears twice on the page: in the profile section at the end of my introduction ("let's chat!") and at the very bottom of the page in the footer section. 

The JavaScript is a combination of found code from helpful resources and my own decisions based on what sort of information I wanted to collect from the user. My validation can be seen if the user attempts to submit the form with all the fields empty and with the "are you a human" checkbox left unchecked. 

The site was built using the Atom text editor. 

Note: for the 8 to Abolition design project, the button links to an external squarespace page that requires a password. The password is 8toabolish. 
Note: rhizomedesignco.com also currently requires a password. That password is rhizome. As a disclaimer, this personal squarespace website for my business is still a work in progress and is not yet finished.
