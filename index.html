        <h2>Work Experience</h2>
        <p>As a non-traditional student with a years-long array of work experience, I am finding fulfillment and enjoyment in my pursuit of a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Graphic Design at Indiana University's Eskenazi School of Art, Architecture, and Design. After honing my time management, personal accountability, and creative problem-solving skills while running the Marketing department for my local grocery co-op for 2 years, I discovered a real passion for Graphic Design. In September 2020, I launched my freelance Graphic Design business, Rhizome Design Co, and look forward to offering my design skills to members of my community. </p>
